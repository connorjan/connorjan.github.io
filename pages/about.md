I currently am a fifth year student at [RIT](http://rit.edu){: target="_blank"}, and
am in the [BS/MS program](http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/program/bsms-electrical-engineering){: target="_blank"} in Electrical Engineering. There are several areas of focus to choose from in the MS degree program and I am in the Digital Design path.

I am very interested in 
Hardware Engineering, Digital Logic Design, Embedded Systems, and Software, however, my main goal is to learn and get some great experiences!

I recently finished an 8 month co-op at <a href="/2015/09/26/railcomm" target="_blank">RailComm</a> working on some really 
great projects.

### Interests
I love sports (namely <a href="http://www.rit.edu/sg/rball" target="_blank">Racquetball</a>, Hockey, and Swimming), 
I enjoy <a href="http://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">Geocaching</a>, Rubik's Cubes and other puzzles, backing projects on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, and many other fun things! 
I also *really* enjoy programming and am very familiar with a bunch of languages but am most proficient with Verilog, Python, and C++.
